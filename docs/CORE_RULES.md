# Core Project Rules

## UI/UX Principles

1.  **Play Button Centering**: The playback controls (Play, Pause, Prev, Next) in the TopBar/Mini Player must ALWAYS be exactly centered horizontally in the window. This layout must be preserved regardless of screen size or side content.

2.  **Queue Visibility**: The current queue position (e.g., "5 / 32") must be visible in the player interface to provide context in the "Endless Stream".

3.  **Explicit Context**: Playback actions (Play, Add to Queue) must always respect the full context of the item (Album/Playlist) unless explicitly playing a single track interrupt.
